## Recommendations 
It is recommended to look further into the data. While temperatures do not vary much over the seasons, it is possible that rains are higher in some months than others. Precipitation data should be evauated. Number of hours of daylight should also be evaluated. Cloud cover is another option for further weather analysis.
